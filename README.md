I am a *Geologist and Potential Fields Geophysicist* who recently (2023) finished my Ph.D. at the Victoria University of Wellington, in New Zealand :new_zealand:. I was part of the [Antarctic Research Centre](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic) where I studied Antarctica's :antarctica: **Ross Ice Shelf** with the use of airborne :airplane: geophysics data from the [ROSETTA-Ice Project](https://pgg.ldeo.columbia.edu/data/rosetta-ice). I completed my undergraduate degree at [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) where I majored in Geology, and began learning about geophysics and Antarctica. 

My PhD thesis can be accessed [here](https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Airborne_Geophysical_Investigation_beneath_Antarctica_s_Ross_Ice_Shelf/24408304), and the latex files and jupyter notebooks to create the figures are in [this GitHub repository](https://github.com/mdtanker/phdthesis). 

## Python Packages
I currently maintain two Python packages: 

* [PolarToolkit](https://antarctic-plots.readthedocs.io/):
  This package provides many tools to help conduct polar/cryospheric research. This includes easily downloading a retrieving a wide range of datasets (i.e. imagery, topography, ice velocity), plotting functions for publication-quality maps and cross-sections, and many other helpful functions.

* [Invert4Geom](https://invert4geom.readthedocs.io/):
  This package allows users to perform 3D gravity inversions for modelling the relief (topography) of an Earth layer. These layers are represented as a density contrast between the above and below materials. Common uses are modeling bathymetry (contrast between water and sediment), basement topography (contrast between sediment and crystalline rock), or the Moho (contrast between crust and mantle).

## Research

past research :zzz:: Determining [magnetic basement](https://github.com/mdtanker/RIS_basement_sediment) topography beneath the Ross Ice Shelf ([GRL paper](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2021GL097371))

current research :hourglass_flowing_sand:: 
Developing a [constrained geometric gravity inversion algorithm](https://github.co./mdtanker/invert4geom.git), aimed at modeling density contrasts such a the Moho or basement

Developing a sub-Ice Shelf [bathymetry model](https://github.com/mdtanker/RIS_gravity_inversion.git) from the inversion of airborne gravity data

future research  :soon:: Expanding the usability and documentation of the above inversion!

Other research interests include:
* geologic controls on ice dynamics
* various applications of geometric non-linear gravity inversions
* groundwater interactions with sub-ice hydrologic system 
* tectonic development of the Ross Embayment
