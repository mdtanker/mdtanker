I am a *Geologist and Potential Fields Geophysicist* working on my Ph.D. at the Victoria University of Wellington, in New Zealand :new_zealand:. I'm part of the [Antarctic Research Centre](https://www.wgtn.ac.nz/antarctic) where I study Antarctica's :antarctica: **Ross Ice Shelf** with the use of airborne :airplane: geophysics data from the [ROSETTA-Ice Project](https://pgg.ldeo.columbia.edu/data/rosetta-ice). I completed my undergraduate degree at [Colorado College](https://www.coloradocollege.edu/) where I majored in Geology, and began learning about geophysics and Antarctica. 

past research :zzz:: Determining [magnetic basement](https://github.com/mdtanker/RIS_basement_sediment) topography beneath the Ross Ice Shelf

current research :hourglass_flowing_sand:: Developing a sub-Ice Shelf [bathymetry model](https://github.com/mdtanker/RIS_gravity_inversion.git) from the inversion of airborne gravity data

future research  :soon:: Estimating geothermal heat flux with airborne magnetics data

Other research interests include:
* geologic controls on ice dynamics
* groundwater interactions with sub-ice hydrologic system 
* tectonic development of the Ross Embayment
